In order to carry out this task, we deployed the HelloWorld.sol contract to Sepolia test net. The contract was successfully deployed to testnet in this transaction:
https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xb2f7692f943143e7ee38102c2c404b23973429c8692ddd3dd1ed5ff3157ad195

From this page, notice we created the new contract at the following address:
0xe1ac38fe99f3b86fb07c26c90ae8d3a243a4b164

The original EOA / wallet address that interacted with the contract was:
0x87C924C1c720AFa2e1c287fE48E822e74c7df2A1

To do this, one of our group members had to:
Create a new account in Metamask and connect to Sepolia testnet as well as get some sepolia test eth to cover gas fees. 

In the next step, we called the setText function for this deployed contract in Remix. We did this in the following transaction:
https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x2458931f3d55f74b21174ced524388b7f349db64884190a1ea6228a8b91d9ee2

Following this we called the transferOwnership function and changed the ownership of the contract to another member of the group. We had to do this because looking at the contract code, it uses an onlyOwner modifier that forces the function caller to be the owner in order to successfully call the transferOwnership function. Once ownership is transferred, the new owner was able to call the setText function and the original owner was not able to call setText anymore.

Continuing with the assignment, we transferred ownership of the original contract to a new address via this transaction: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x8616b89c43312d542e84c0efc1f4c8d63279b9946c9d927912c795505ded2140

Now when the original owner calls setText, they get the expected error 'Caller is not the owner':
https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xc984846cc401f0aecdeeea498915afd3f124dd880f8b42e7fe075918ba4c6262

The new contract owner was able to call setText then via this transaction:
https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xa604bcdb68dcba5fb0e927052844c0a5adb6765f8cfd0c299f4973338d9097ac

We again transferred ownership to a new group members EOA account via this transaction:
https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x0d5579bf446b3cda4ba0ed01f18a1e64362602af9394424854525f97e33bbd21

And the previous contract owner got the expected error again 'Caller is not the owner': https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x0613aabae52c54b0f406881e772fef0ce95db518dc247c89912da5f79df8a175

Finally, they could see that they were in fact the new owner and were able to change the text again: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xe99a83282f964c0f9d92aed48646bed7e8ba7a36ca62e2b6e71d86daf8671254
